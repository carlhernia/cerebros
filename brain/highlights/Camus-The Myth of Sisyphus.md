## Highlights

THERE is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. — location: [93](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=93) ^ref-61287

Living, naturally, is never easy. You continue making the gestures commanded by existence for many reasons, the first of which is habit. Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering. — location: [124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=124) ^ref-54824

---
This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity. All healthy men having thought of their own suicide, it can be seen, without further explanation, that there is a direct connection between this feeling and the longing for death. — location: [130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=130) ^ref-12150

---
The body’s judgment is as good as the mind’s, and the body shrinks from annihilation. We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking. — location: [151](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=151) ^ref-15206

---
Thus everything contributes to spreading confusion. Hitherto, and it has not been wasted effort, people have played on words and pretended to believe that refusing to grant a meaning to life necessarily leads to declaring that it is not worth living. In truth, there is no necessary common measure between these two judgments. — location: [156](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=156) ^ref-62493

It is always easy to be logical. It is almost impossible to be logical to the bitter end. Men who die by their own hand consequently follow to its conclusion their emotional inclination. — location: [165](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=165) ^ref-21640

He belongs to time, and by the horror that seizes him, he recognizes his worst enemy. Tomorrow, he was longing for tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it. That revolt of the flesh is the absurd.*4 — location: [220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=220) ^ref-8961

A man is talking on the telephone behind a glass partition; you cannot hear him, but you see his incomprehensible dumb show: you wonder why he is alive. This discomfort in the face of man’s own inhumanity, this incalculable tumble before the image of what we are, this “nausea,” as a writer of today calls it, is also the absurd. — location: [233](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=233) ^ref-30938

This very heart which is mine will forever remain indefinable to me. Between the certainty I have of my existence and the content I try to give to that assurance, the gap will never be filled. Forever I shall be a stranger to myself. — location: [286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=286) ^ref-27282

---
A stranger to myself and to the world, armed solely with a thought that negates itself as soon as it asserts, what is this condition in which I can have peace only by refusing to know and to live, in which the appetite for conquest bumps into walls that defy its assaults? To will is to stir up paradoxes. — location: [301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=301) ^ref-11333

This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. For the moment it is all that links them together. It binds them one to the other as only hatred can weld two creatures together. — location: [311](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07HLQQZ3L&location=311) ^ref-24991
