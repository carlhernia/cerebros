## Highlights

The argument of this book is that we, and all other animals, are machines created by our genes. — location: [432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=432) ^ref-24091

---
I shall argue that a predominant quality to be expected in a successful gene is ruthless selfishness. This gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behaviour. — location: [434](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=434) ^ref-52208

---
Much as we might wish to believe otherwise, universal love and the welfare of the species as a whole are concepts that simply do not make evolutionary sense. — location: [437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=437) ^ref-20979

---
Among animals, man is uniquely dominated by culture, by influences learned and handed down. — location: [451](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=451) ^ref-63383

---
‘Perpetuation of the species’ is a common euphemism for reproduction, and it is undeniably a consequence of reproduction. It requires only a slight over-stretching of logic to deduce that the ‘function’ of reproduction is ‘to’ perpetuate the species. — location: [525](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=525) ^ref-22097

---
Even while the group is going slowly and inexorably downhill, selfish individuals prosper in the short term at the expense of altruists. — location: [551](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=551) ^ref-36912

---
Often altruism within a group goes with selfishness between groups. This is a basis of trade unionism. — location: [572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=572) ^ref-65065

---
(Curiously, peace-time appeals for individuals to make some small sacrifice in the rate at which they increase their standard of living seem to be less effective than war-time appeals for individuals to lay down their lives.) — location: [575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=575) ^ref-64215

---
I suppose the scholars of the Septuagint could at least be said to have started something big when they mistranslated the Hebrew word for ‘young woman’ into the Greek word for ‘virgin’, coming up with the prophecy: ‘Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son …’* — location: [704](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=704) ^ref-58268

---
Human suffering has been caused because too many of us cannot grasp that words are only tools for our use, and that the mere presence in the dictionary of a word like ‘living’ does not mean it necessarily has to refer to something definite in the real world. — location: [743](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=743) ^ref-27307

---
Replicators began not merely to exist, but to construct for themselves containers, vehicles for their continued existence. The replicators that survived were the ones that built survival machines for themselves to live in. — location: [760](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=760) ^ref-44787

---
They have come a long way, those replicators. Now they go by the name of genes, and we are their survival machines. — location: [771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=771) ^ref-33883

---
No matter how much knowledge and wisdom you acquire during your life, not one jot will be passed on to your children by genetic means. Each new generation starts from scratch. A body is the genes’ way of preserving the genes unaltered. — location: [826](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=826) ^ref-28123

---
A gene is defined as any portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection. — location: [926](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=926) ^ref-53349

---
One of your genetic units may also be present in your second cousin. It may be present in me, and in the Prime Minister, and in your dog, for we all share ancestors if we go back far enough. Also the same small unit might be assembled several times independently by chance: if the unit is small, the coincidence is not too improbable. — location: [968](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=968) ^ref-25979

---
When we have served our purpose we are cast aside. But genes are denizens of geological time: genes are forever. — location: [1054](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1054) ^ref-37588

---
The gene is defined as a piece of chromosome which is sufficiently short for it to last, potentially, for long enough for it to function as a significant unit of natural selection. — location: [1067](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1067) ^ref-47651

---
Any gene that behaves in such a way as to increase its own survival chances in the gene pool at the expense of its alleles will, by definition, tautologously, tend to survive. The gene is the basic unit of selfishness. — location: [1085](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1085) ^ref-8065

---
According to this theory then, senile decay is simply a by-product of the accumulation in the gene pool of late-acting lethal and semi-lethal genes, which have been allowed to slip through the net of natural selection simply because they are late-acting. — location: [1172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1172) ^ref-23354

---
By definition, a copying error is to the disadvantage of the gene which is miscopied. But if it is to the advantage of the selfish mutator gene that induces it, the mutator can spread through the gene pool. — location: [1236](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1236) ^ref-5589

---
The true ‘purpose’ of DNA is to survive, no more and no less. The simplest way to explain the surplus DNA is to suppose that it is a parasite, or at best a harmless but useless passenger, hitching a ride in the survival machines created by the other DNA. — location: [1250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1250) ^ref-6275

---
The currency used in the casino of evolution is survival, strictly gene survival, but for many purposes individual survival is a reasonable approximation. — location: [1462](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1462) ^ref-65390

---
One way for genes to solve the problem of making predictions in rather unpredictable environments is to build in a capacity for learning. — location: [1484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1484) ^ref-4110

---
The evolution of the capacity to simulate seems to have culminated in subjective consciousness. — location: [1530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1530) ^ref-7719

Consciousness can be thought of as a secondary effect to learning to simulate for survival machines, as opposed to the goal.

Simulation here means thinking ahead, basically, as opposed to tria and error.

---
Perhaps consciousness arises when the brain’s simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself. — location: [1532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1532) ^ref-51194

---
The genes are master programmers, and they are programming for their lives. They are judged according to the success of their programs in coping with all the hazards that life throws at their survival machines, and the judge is the ruthless judge of the court of survival. — location: [1596](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1596) ^ref-58200

---
However, we must expect lies and deceit, and selfish exploitation of communication to arise whenever the interests of the genes of different individuals diverge. This will include individuals of the same species. As we shall see, we must even expect that children will deceive their parents, that husbands will cheat on wives, and that brother will lie to brother. — location: [1653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1653) ^ref-47986

---
An evolutionarily stable strategy or ESS is defined as a strategy which, if most members of a population adopt it, cannot be bettered by an alternative strategy. — location: [1730](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1730) ^ref-21406

---
But unfortunately, in conspiracies of doves, a single hawk does so extremely well that nothing could stop the evolution of hawks. The conspiracy is therefore bound to be broken by treachery from within. An ESS is stable, not because it is particularly good for the individuals participating in it, but simply because it is immune to treachery from within. — location: [1795](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1795) ^ref-1441

---
So, even in man, a species with the gift of conscious foresight, pacts or conspiracies based on long-term best interests teeter constantly on the brink of collapse due to treachery from within. In wild animals, controlled by the struggling genes, it is even more difficult to see ways in which group benefit or conspiracy strategies could possibly evolve. We must expect to find evolutionarily stable strategies everywhere. — location: [1806](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1806) ^ref-43676

---
Territorial ‘defence’ may simply be an ESS which arises because of the asymmetry in time of arrival that usually characterizes the relationship between two individuals and a patch of ground. — location: [1945](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1945) ^ref-624

---
If animals such as crickets, who work with a general memory of past fights, are kept together in a closed group for a time, a kind of dominance hierarchy is likely to develop. — location: [1977](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1977) ^ref-53568

---
The individual behaviour patterns that manifest themselves in the form of dominance hierarchies when viewed at the group level may be said to have functions. It is, however, even better to abandon the word ‘function’ altogether, and to think about the matter in terms of ESSs in asymmetric contests where there is individual recognition and memory. — location: [1994](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01GI5F2FS&location=1994) ^ref-30379
