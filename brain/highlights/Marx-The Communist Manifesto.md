## Highlights

By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of wage labour. By proletariat, the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labour power in order to live. — location: [57](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086XG8P2T&location=57) ^ref-12956

Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat. — location: [67](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086XG8P2T&location=67) ^ref-8329

We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange. — location: [83](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086XG8P2T&location=83) ^ref-46761

The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie. — location: [90](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086XG8P2T&location=90) ^ref-3253

bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, — location: [110](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B086XG8P2T&location=110) ^ref-26998
