On a diagram of the solar system to scale, with Earth reduced to about the diameter of a pea, Jupiter would be over a thousand feet away and Pluto would be a mile and a half distant (and about the size of a bacterium, so you wouldn’t be able to see it anyway). — location: [417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FBFNII&location=417) ^ref-32550
