For a second I had the ridiculous feeling that they were there to judge me. — location: [152](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=152) ^ref-60187

Then finally she shut up. I didn’t feel drowsy anymore, but I was tired and my back was hurting me. Now it was all these people not making a sound that was getting on my nerves. — location: [160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=160) ^ref-37468

---
It occurred to me that anyway one more Sunday was over, that Maman was buried now, that I was going back to work, and that, really, nothing had changed. — location: [302](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=302) ^ref-51811

Looking back on it, I wasn’t unhappy. When I was a student, I had lots of ambitions like that. But when I had to give up my studies I learned very quickly that none of it really mattered. — location: [478](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=478) ^ref-37788

---
Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness. — location: [664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=664) ^ref-61426

On my way out I was even going to shake his hand, but just in time, I remembered that I had killed a man. — location: [678](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=678) ^ref-34731

I explained to him, however, that my nature was such that my physical needs often got in the way of my feelings. — location: [690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=690) ^ref-46992

When I was first imprisoned, the hardest thing was that my thoughts were still those of a free man. — location: [805](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=805) ^ref-38710

---
At the time, I often thought that if I had had to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but look up at the sky flowering overhead, little by little I would have gotten used to it. — location: [809](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=809) ^ref-55553

---
I realized then that a man who had lived only one day could easily live for a hundred years in prison. He would have enough memories to keep him from being bored. In a way, it was an advantage. — location: [834](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=834) ^ref-52720

Everything was happening without my participation. My fate was being decided without anyone so much as asking my opinion. — location: [1033](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=1033) ^ref-58236

Maman used to say that you can always find something to be happy about. In my prison, when the sky turned red and a new day slipped into my cell, I found out that she was right. — location: [1186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=1186) ^ref-42360

“Well, so I’m going to die.” Sooner than other people will, obviously. But everybody knows life isn’t worth living. — location: [1192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=1192) ^ref-64471

---
Since we’re all going to die, it’s obvious that when and how don’t matter. — location: [1197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=1197) ^ref-35502

“Have you no hope at all? And do you really live with the thought that when you die, you die, and nothing remains?” “Yes,” I said. — location: [1232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=1232) ^ref-54439

He wasn’t even sure he was alive, because he was living like a dead man. Whereas it looked as if I was the one who’d come up emptyhanded. But I was sure about me, about everything, surer than he could ever be, sure of my life and sure of the death I had waiting for me. — location: [1264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=1264) ^ref-45387

---
For everything to be consummated, for me to feel less alone, I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate. — location: [1289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008QLXSG8&location=1289) ^ref-45225
