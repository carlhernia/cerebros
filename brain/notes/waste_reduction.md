# recycling

## blue bin:
- plastic bottles and jars
- metal cans (including empty aerosol)
- glass bottles and jars
- beverage cartons

## orange bin
- brown paper bags and newspapers
- magazines, catalogs, and phone books
- corrugated cardboard and pasteboard
- office paper and junk mail
- paperback books, workbooks, and soft-back textbooks
- shredded paper contained inside a paper bag

# composting

this process requires five components:
1. carbon (C)
2. nitrogen (N)
3. oxygen(O2)
4. moisture
5. microorganisms

## 3 stages of composting
|                     |                  stage 1                  |                    stage 2                     |        stage 3         |
| ------------------- |:-----------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
| temperature         |                 68-113 F                  |                   113-252 F                    |        68-113 F        |
| microorganisms      |                mesophilic                 |                  thermophilic                  |       mesophilic       |
| length of time      |                 5-10 days                 |             days to several months             |     several months     |
| processes occurring | breakdown of materials into smaller piece | breakdown of proteins, fats, and complex carbs | cooling and maturation |

## what to compost
| brown materials | green materials          |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| leaves          | fruit/veggie peels       |
| pine needles    | citrus rinds             |
| twigs, branches | coffee grounds           |
| straw, hay      | tea bags                 |
| paper           | dryer lint               |
| dryer lint      | grass clippings          |
| pine cones      | eggshells                |
| napkins         | weeds                    |
| wood chips      | stale bread              |
| cardboard       | cooked plain rice, pasta |

brown materials are carbon-rich, whereas green materials are nitrogen-based waste materials

### tip:
a simple rule of thumb is to make sure the compost pile is approximately 2/3 "brown" and 1/3 "green" materials
